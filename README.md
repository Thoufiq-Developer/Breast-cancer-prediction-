# Breast-cancer-prediction-
This project focuses on building a predictive model to detect breast cancer using machine learning algorithms. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset, the model classifies tumors as malignant or benign based on features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.
